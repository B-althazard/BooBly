Keep unknown keys.\n3) For each key: if the JSON value is empty or missing, choose a value from the KVDB values list that best matches the user\u2019s intent; otherwise keep the JSON value.\n4) Produce:\n   A) Final JSON (same structure as input, filled where missing)\n   B) A single \u201cFINAL IMAGE PROMPT\u201d string (deterministic, concrete, non-metaphorical) suitable for OpenAI Image Generation.\n   C) A \u201cNEGATIVE PROMPT\u201d string (style + anatomy failure blockers), only if requested.\nRules:\n- Use camera-valid terms (lens, angle, distance, DOF) and concrete physical descriptors.\n- Avoid vague adjectives; prioritize measurable/visual traits.\n- Preserve identity-critical fields (pose, outfit, colors, expression) unless explicitly overridden.",
